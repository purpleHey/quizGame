README.md

A simple game that reads in a list of math problems from a .csv file that looks like:

```
5+4, 9
3+4, 7
```

This programs demonstrates the use of the `flags` package to parse command line arguments, as well as some simple file reading and parsing using the `io` package.

The problems come from Jon Cahoun's online [Gopher exercises](https://gophercises.com) course.
